    <p>Master the art of the classic Tom Collins cocktail, plus three twists. Gin, lemon, sugar syrup and soda water are the ingredients for your cocktail cupboard</p>
    <h2>list on ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50ml gin</li>
        <li>25ml lemon juice</li>
        <li>25ml sugar syrup</li>
        <li>125ml chilled soda water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>Build the drink over plenty of ice in a Collins glass, stir gently and garnish with a slice of lemon.</p>

    <h4>Spice Up Your Drink</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Raspberry Collins</strong>
            Raspberries give this twist on the classic Collins a pretty splash of colour. Start by gently muddling a handful of raspberries in the bottom of an empty Collins glass, then add the ice, all the other ingredients and mix well with a long handled spoon. Garnish with an orange slice.</li>

        <li><strong>Brandy Collins</strong>
             This is a really refreshing way to enjoy cognac. For best results, use a young-ish VS or VSOP cognac thatâ€™s nice and fruity. Just make the drink as normal, substituting cognac for gin, then garnish with a slice of ginger or a ribbon of lemon peel.</li>  

        <li><strong>Elderflower Collins</strong>
             Elderflower and lemon is a winning combination. You can make it with elderflower cordial or liqueur for something a touch more boozy. Mix the drink as normal, but use the liqueur or cordial in place of the sugar syrup. Garnish with a lemon slice.</li>
    </ul>
