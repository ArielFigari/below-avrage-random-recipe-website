        <h2>classic lasagna recipe</h2>
        <p> is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>

        <h3>Lasagna Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>

            <li> <strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>

            <li> <strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>

            <li> <strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>

            <li> <strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>

            <li> <strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>

            <li> <strong>Cheeses</strong> : Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>

            <li> <strong>egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>

        </ul>
